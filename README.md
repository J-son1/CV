I am an ambitious, inquisitive and driven Full-Stack Junior Developer focused on growth within the tech industry. With a solid programming foundation, having graduated from the Makers Academy coding bootcamp, I am committed to utilising existing experience and skills to add value within a collaborative environment.

Prior to my career change into tech, I worked as a computer-aided design (CAD) technician, which enabled me to get technical while solving problems resulting in high quality, efficiently delivered projects. Having also studied architecture at university, I have developed invaluable insights and an outlook on planning, process and design, which has served me well as I continually expand my coding skills.

Software covers a lot of areas of interest for me and I am keen to discover more as I develop. Technology’s power, to make life even better in very inspiring and innovative ways, is what fuels my passion for the industry and I am so excited to continue to grow my skillset, contribute and be an asset to any team that I join.

## Work Experience

#### Adama Consulting Civil & Infrastructure Engineering Design (January 2017 - November 2021)  
_CAD technician_

- Responsible and accountable for producing work to a high degree of accuracy to be issued for construction and sent to clients.

- Exercised time management and organisational skills when working on concurrent projects, switching between each to complete tasks in accordance with priority.

- Adapted to a field of work outside of qualifications by quickly learning new skills within a new discipline.

- Used an analytical eye to calculate ground levels for new developments as well as refine Architects’ plans to create clear and concise engineering drawings to work from.

- Put to use good communication skills and teamwork working directly with the company stakeholder to deliver projects.

- Applied constant learning to the role by finding new ways to get the most out of the software used in order to increase productivity.

### Professional Skills

#### Attention to detail
Working within Civil Engineering required a high level of attention to detail and discipline when completing tasks. I quickly put to use good working practices coupled with being organised, which lead to high quality, efficiently delivered work. This approach to working also proved very useful during my time at the Makers coding bootcamp. I was able to effectively learn and implement best practices for writing code, paying attention to details from syntax and style to higher level processes of object oriented programming, ensuring the use of good OOD and SOLID principles.

#### Problem solving
Throughout the roles I’ve worked in, problem solving has been an integral part of what I do. My background in architecture helped to develop and refine my approach to solving issues by getting to the root of a problem. Planning and diagramming have been key parts of my working process, which I was able to carry over to the Makers course and learning to code. There were many occasions over the coding bootcamp that engaged my problem solving skills. Examples of this include proficiently debugging errors in my own code as well as code shared with pair partners; also, creating a solution to help my team to get unstuck in the planning stage of a group project, enabling us to move forward and produce a fully functional product.

#### Dedicated Learner
At the beginning of my role as a CAD technician, I received limited training on the software used for work. However, I already had a strong interest in using this application and took the initiative to learn more about it in my own time. I delved deeper into finding lesser known tools and settings within the software to streamline my workflow (with my knowledge of the software being noted as impressive by a member of the software’s technical support team). This often required creative thinking and problem solving to take advantage of the tools available in the large-scale application. This approach to working has resulted in me finding much faster ways to get tasks done, which I could then share with the team to increase productivity within the company.

#### Adaptability
After entering the field of Civil Engineering - a sector outside of my qualifications - I exercised my ability to adapt by quickly learning how to carry out my new role. Applying constant learning to execute my job well, I grew within my role and was a valid team member for many years. This ability to adapt proved useful throughout the Makers course. Being presented with the challenge of learning new programming languages, I was able to quickly understand them while maintaining the ability to confidently switch between and use each one. This knowledge of newly learned technologies enabled me to spot and fix a bug in a major feature of our final group project on the course.
